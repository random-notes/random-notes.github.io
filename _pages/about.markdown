Hello, Thank you for clicking on this About page! A little introduction on myself, I'm Baoxu, or you can call me Dash (大史) :). I'm just another software engineer who spent five years in grad school and survived.

You can find me on GitHub or Twitter, where I mostly tweet in Chinese, and sometimes #NSFW.

If you have further questions about Knowledge Graph, Deep Learning, or anything related to Ph.D. life at ND, just leave a comment or shot me an email if you can find it.
