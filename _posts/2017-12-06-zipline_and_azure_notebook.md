Summary: Zipline is a financial data package offered by [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/). You can use their internal notebook environment, but it is still in beta (i believe so) and it is not super functional. Instead of settting up your own Jupyter-notebook environment on your local machine, you can just use [Azure Jupyter Notebook](https://notebooks.azure.com/) to achieve this.

I'm always fancistnated by how my friend applies his financial + CS background to trading and want to learn how to do this. Instead of reading hundred pages of financial reports, I want to do it in the machine learning way (or quantitative analysis, depends on what is your background). So the first step would be setting up a good development environment. Unfortunately, I do not have an up-to-date machine so installing everything on my laptop is a bit hard, so I start to looking into alternative solutions.

So far, Azure Jupyter Notebook is the best *free* solution -- it is essentially just the Jupyter Notebook (it even has the logo on it), and it has enough space for me to install zipline.
